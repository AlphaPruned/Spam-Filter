# Spam-Filter

Developed a spam filter to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam using probabilistic reasoning. Loaded and preprocessed the dataset by removing numbers and symbolic characters, and normalizing text. Extracted features using word frequency analysis, excluding common stop words. Implemented conditional probability calculations to determine the likelihood of a message being spam based on word occurrences. Utilized Python, CSV handling, and regular expressions to build and test the classifier.
